# summary of HTML

when you want to build any website, in the beginning we must imagine what will do or how the web site will appear to the user. so, it is good idea to start with warframe to design the pages.
After that, we use the HTML to transfer our design to actually pages on the website. ~~sorry you must dont worry about that.~~

### Html is a Hyper Text of Markup Language
#### we use it as wrap our Text with TAgs  for example ```<p> be or not to be </p>```

***Also we use the HTML to add a content to our web pages
and structure our website***


### Anatomy of an HTML document look at the picture:

#### The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
