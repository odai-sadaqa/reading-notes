A growth mindset is the mindset that always aspires to success, faces problems and solves them. This makes you more productive and leads to success in various areas of practical life.

Making mistakes is a possible thing, so do not stop at it, but make it a motivation for you to learn from your mistakes.
The sharing of successful people with their joy of success is a wonderful thing to learn from them.
