**A simple way to look at this is through the “left brain vs. right brain” theory, which goes that everyone has a dominant side of the brain (the right or the left), and it determines their personality, thoughts and behavior.**

   - Right brained people are said to be more intuitive, creative, free-thinking and have the ability to collaborate and connect. They are the relationship-builders, and they are vital to a team’s success.

   - Left brained people, by contrast, are more logical, analytical and objective. Unlike right brained people, who tend to think in visuals, left brains are detail- and fact-oriented, and they prefer to think in words and numbers. 
   
     - They are more pragmatic. While left brain skills and traits may distinguish individual contributors, they are only table stakes (literally, as they can mostly earn you a seat at a team’s table).



### The key characteristics of ‘enhanced teams’
**After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.**

“We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference.“

Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:  
```Psychological safety:```
Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.  
```Dependability:```  
Everyone completes quality work on time.  
```Structure and clarity:```  
Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.  
```Meaning:```  
Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).  
```Impact:```
Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.`
