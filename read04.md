# JavaScript


***JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, ~~such as Node.~~js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles***


#### JavaScript Identifiers
1.  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

2. These unique names are called identifiers.

3. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

4. The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

 - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names


### JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

### JavaScript Data Types
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

``` var pi = 3.14; ```   
```var person = "John Doe"; ```  
```var answer = 'Yes I am!```  


Start the statement with var and separate the variables by **comma**:

```var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;```

As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like ```=``` , ```+```,```*```and ```-```:


If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated. ```var x = 2 + 3 + "5";```

 ***JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.***



in JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

- Use ```if ```to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use ```else``` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use ```else if``` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false


Also, we can applied dynamic function on our website:

### Alert: 
it is use showing information to user, when open website 
or when click on specific button.
ex:  
``` alert (" any information")```

### prompt:
~~it used~~  it used to take information from users and we can assign to a variable.

use function ```documint.write```   
it is a way of writing any want to  HTML
for java script

ex:

```documint.write ("<p>" + " what is your dream " + "</p>"```
